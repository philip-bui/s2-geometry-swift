## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+ / macOS 10.9+ / tvOS 9.0+ / watchOS 2.0+
- xCode 10.3+
- Swift 4.0+ 

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate S2Geometry into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'S2GeometrySwift'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate S2GeometrySwift into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "philip-bui/S2GeometrySwift"
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but S2Geometry does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding S2Geometry as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/philip-bui/s2-geometry-swift.git", from: "1.0.1"))
]
```
