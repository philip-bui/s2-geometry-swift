/**
	An S2Region represents a two-dimensional region over the unit sphere. It is
	an abstract interface with various concrete subtypes.

	The main purpose of this interface is to allow complex regions to be
	approximated as simpler regions. So rather than having a wide variety of
	virtual methods that are implemented by all subtypes, the interface is
	restricted to methods that are useful for computing approximations.
