/**
	An S2RegionCoverer is a class that allows arbitrary regions to be
	approximated as unions of cells (S2CellUnion). This is useful for
	implementing various sorts of search and precomputation operations.

	Typical usage: {@code S2RegionCoverer coverer; coverer.setMaxCells(5); S2Cap
	cap = S2Cap.fromAxisAngle(...); S2CellUnion covering;
	coverer.getCovering(cap, covering); * }

	This yields a cell union of at most 5 cells that is guaranteed to cover the
	given cap (a disc-shaped region on the sphere).

	The approximation algorithm is not optimal but does a pretty good job in
	practice. The output does not always use the maximum number of cells allowed,
	both because this would not always yield a better approximation, and because
	max_cells() is a limit on how much work is done exploring the possible
	covering as well as a limit on the final output size.

	One can also generate interior coverings, which are sets of cells which are
	entirely contained within a region. Interior coverings can be empty, even for
	non-empty regions, if there are no cells that satisfy the provided
	constraints and are contained by the region. Note that for performance
	reasons, it is wise to specify a max_level when computing interior coverings -
	otherwise for regions with small or zero area, the algorithm may spend a
	lot of time subdividing cells all the way to leaf level to try to find
	contained cells.

	This class is thread-unsafe. Simultaneous calls to any of the getCovering
	methods will conflict and produce unpredictable results.

		is the minimum number of cells required (e.g. if the region intersects all
		six face cells). Up to 3 cells may be returned even for very tiny convex
		regions if they happen to be located at the intersection of three cube

		- For any setting of max_cells(), an arbitrary number of cells may be
