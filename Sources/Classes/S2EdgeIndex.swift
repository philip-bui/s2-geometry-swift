		If the index hasn't been computed yet, looks at how much work has gone into

		from the beginning, then compute it now. This guarantees that we will never
		use more than twice the time we would have used had we known in advance
		exactly how many edges we would have wanted to test. It is the theoretical
		best.
	
		The value 'n' is the number of iterators we expect to request from this
		edge index.
	
		If we have m data edges and n query edges, then the brute force cost is m
		* n * testCost where testCost is taken to be the cost of
		EdgeCrosser.robustCrossing, measured to be about 30ns at the time of this
		writing.
	
		If we compute the index, the cost becomes: m * costInsert + n *
		costFind(m)
	
		- costInsert can be expected to be reasonably stable, and was measured at
		1200ns with the BM_QuadEdgeInsertionCost benchmark.
	
		- costFind depends on the length of the edge . For m=1000 edges, we got
		timings ranging from 1ms (edge the length of the polygon) to 40ms. The
		latter is for very long query edges, and needs to be optimized. We will
		assume for the rest of the discussion that costFind is roughly 3ms.
	
		When doing one additional query, the differential cost is m * testCost -
		costFind(m) With the numbers above, it is better to use the quad tree (if
		we have it) if m >= 100.
	
		If m = 100, 30 queries will give m*n*testCost = m * costInsert = 100ms,
		while the marginal cost to find is 3ms. Thus, this is a reasonable thing to
		do.
