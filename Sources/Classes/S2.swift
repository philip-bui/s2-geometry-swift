	// (non-spherical) triangle defined by the three vertices. Second, there is
	// the surface centroid, which is defined as the intersection of the three
	// medians of the spherical triangle. It is possible to show that this
	// point is simply the planar centroid projected to the surface of the
	// sphere. Finally, there is the true centroid (mass centroid), which is
	// defined as the area integral over the spherical triangle of (x,y,z)
	// divided by the triangle area. This is the point that the triangle would
	// rotate around if it was spinning in empty space.
	//
	// The best centroid for most purposes is the true centroid. Unlike the
	// planar and surface centroids, the true centroid behaves linearly as
	// regions are added or subtracted. That is, if you split a triangle into
	// pieces and compute the average of their centroids (weighted by triangle
	// area), the result equals the centroid of the original triangle. This is
	// not true of the other centroids.
	//
	// Also note that the surface centroid may be nowhere near the intuitive
	// "center" of a spherical triangle. For example, consider the triangle
	// with vertices A=(1,eps,0), B=(0,0,1), C=(-1,eps,0) (a quarter-sphere).
	// The surface centroid of this triangle is at S=(0, 2*eps, 1), which is
	// within a distance of 2*eps of the vertex B. Note that the median from A
	// (the segment connecting A to the midpoint of BC) passes through S, since
	// this is the shortest path connecting the two endpoints. On the other
	// hand, the true centroid is at M=(0, 0.5, 0.5), which when projected onto
	// the surface is a much more reasonable interpretation of the "center" of
	// this triangle.
