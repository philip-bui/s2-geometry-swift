/**
	This class represents a spherical cap, i.e. a portion of a sphere cut off by
	a plane. The cap is defined by its axis and height. This representation has
	good numerical accuracy for very small caps (unlike the (axis,
	min-distance-from-origin) representation), and is also efficient for
	containment tests (unlike the (axis, angle) representation).

	Here are some useful relationships between the cap height (h), the cap
	opening angle (theta), the maximum chord length from the cap's center (d),
	and the radius of cap's base (a). All formulas assume a unit radius.

	h = 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2) d^2 = 2 h = a^2 + h^2
